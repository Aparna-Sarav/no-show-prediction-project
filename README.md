# 🏥 Predicting Patient Appointment No-Shows at Healthcare Clinics

This project analyzes medical appointment data to identify patterns in patient no-shows and builds a machine learning model to predict them. Inspired by real-world healthcare systems like **Ochsner Health in Louisiana**, the goal is to help hospitals reduce missed appointments, improve patient engagement, and allocate resources better.

## 🔍 Problem

No-shows in healthcare lead to:
- Wasted clinical time
- Poor health outcomes
- Increased operational costs

**Can we predict who might miss their appointment — and why?**

---

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - No Show Appointments](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments)
- 110,000+ appointments in Brazil
- Features: age, gender, SMS reminders, health conditions, neighborhood, and no-show status

---

## 💡 Key Findings

- Patients who **didn’t receive SMS reminders were 30% more likely** to miss their appointments.
- **Younger patients** missed more often than older ones.
- **Women** had slightly higher no-show rates than men.
- Certain **neighborhoods** had higher concentrations of no-shows.

## 🧠 Model

- Used `Logistic Regression` to predict no-shows (yes/no)
- Accuracy: ~ [fill your result here]
- Evaluated with classification report and confusion matrix

---

## 📈 Dashboard (Tableau Public)

An interactive dashboard was created to visualize:
- No-show rates by age, gender, SMS reminder
- Top neighborhoods with highest no-show frequency

## 🧪 Tools Used

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- Tableau Public
- Google Colab
- GitHub

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Use real Ochsner data (HIPAA-compliant)
- Include appointment type and lead time
- Test reminder interventions (A/B testing)
